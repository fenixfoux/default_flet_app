# Flet App Blueprint

This project serves as a starting blueprint for writing apps using [Flet](https://flet.dev/). It includes:

- A **readable folder structure** (at least for me, I plan to improve it as I gain more experience ðŸ˜„).
- A **simple and understandable routing system** (I hope it is!), along with a default app bar.

### Features
- Organized code structure to make development easier.
- Basic routing to handle multiple pages.
- Built-in language switching functionality.
  
### Planned Updates
As I continue learning and exploring new features in Flet, I'll update this project with:
- More complex components.
- Improved architecture and design patterns.

Feel free to use this as a starting point and modify it as needed for your own projects!

Stay tuned for more updates as I learn and grow ðŸš€
